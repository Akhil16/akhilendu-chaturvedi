                    I am a Software Developer from India. Hindi is my native language, and I am fluent in English.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I've had the chance to work with a range of <span class="default-highlight">technologies</span> and developed valuable 
                    <span class="default-highlight">soft skills</span>, including leading transformative changes to improve 
                    team dynamics and organizational culture within a tech company. My technical knowledge has expanded 
                    through hands-on collaboration with developers and rigorous study of documentation. Over time, I've gained experience 
                    with programming logic, refined software craftsmanship, contributed to the development of 
                    <span class="default-highlight">websites</span> and built <span class="default-highlight">REST APIs</span>, 
                    collaborated on building visual dashboards.

                <p class="default-p">
                    I've worked with teams to adopt <span class="default-highlight">Monorepo architectures</span> using tools like
                    <span class="default-highlight">Nx</span>, <span class="default-highlight">lerna</span>.
                    I've also been part of efforts to develop and maintain asynchronous systems and optimizing CI/CD pipelines mainly using 
                    <span class="default-highlight">github DevOps</span> and YAML configurations.

                    I do think <span class="default-highlight">DevOps</span> plays such an important role in enhancing 
                    <span class="default-highlight">collaboration</span> between <span class="default-highlight">development</span> 
                    and <span class="default-highlight">operations</span> teams because it <span class="default-highlight">streamlines</span> 
                    processes and improves the overall <span class="default-highlight">efficiency and quality of software delivery</span>. 
                    The optimization of workflows and reduction of system delays are significant factors for the success of project outcomes.

                    I have been involved in creating and managing <span class="default-highlight">MongoDB</span> 
                    databases, working on stream processing, and data pipelines. My work also involved handling secure authentication 
                    with <span class="default-highlight">OAuth2.0</span> and <span class="default-highlight">JWT</span>, 
                    as well as conducting User Acceptance Testing (UATs), performing manual testing, and writing user manual guides with  
                    <span class="default-highlight">Jest</span> and assisted in monitoring applications using 
                    <span class="default-highlight">NewRelic</span>
